My finger hurts :( 

Goals:

* Sober up
* Make life not suck
* Find my slice of piece and quiet 
* Get my shit compartmentalized for quick and easy departure 
* Go to urgent care @ 8:30am tomorrow 
* Draft up a list of projects I want to work on this weekend

  * Try to pick 3 "small" projects & draft up to-do list for each
  * Create WWDWBW Trello cards
