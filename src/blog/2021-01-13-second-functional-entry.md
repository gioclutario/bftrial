Today will just be a quick write up regarding successfully deploying my new website. I'm still going through the book in order to modify my website in order to make it more professional looking but for now this seems to be what I wanted. I'm utilizing a lot more unique libraries and methodologies that i've never practiced before (e.g. using transformers, running queries to build sites, using Netlify, and a whole multitude of others to mention in a separate post). For now, the website is functional however my goals for the next iterations should be the following: 

* Complete Book Tutorial
* Redesign the front-end using CSS tricks
* Establish resume and upload some portfolio worthy content 

  * At the moment this should be only be my LJ_MD. I need to create a write up for this to be more presentable! Also, look into reestablishing some of the simple graphics!
