###### Random Rant

In the next coming months I want to complete the following:

1. Improve time management 
2. Schedule my dailies, weeklies, & monthlies consistently 
3. Create a Django website(?)/applications 
4. Improve my React/JS skills 
5. Review Molecular Dynamics practices and rewrite former project 
6. Complete Codecademy Data Science & Web Development paths


I'm hoping that in the following weeks I can slowly work on these activities. I need to consistently make working on these tasks a habit. The idea is that by end of March I will at least have my Django website complete! I need to improve my development time if I do want to get a job soon but i'm glad to at least have a functional website with a little bit better understand of using Gatsby & Netlify CSM. I can't really tell if I made a proper JAMstack website but at least I have a website hosted!
