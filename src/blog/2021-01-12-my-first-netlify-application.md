After following the quick and easy book, I was able to deploy this netlify app! I'm currently using the Netlify CMS API to get it functioning but somehow it's not too bad! I'll probably work on getting the JS for the actual website going soon but that's for another day! Yay! **It's working**! What a good night's work! Took me only about 6 hours overall? Maybe in reality less than 1 hour of actual development time though. Good night for night y'all!
