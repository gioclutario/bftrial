I'm glad to say that as of this blog post, I'm official done with my Gatsby & Netlify CMS tutorial! I finally deployed my first website! I'm really happy this got up and running :)! I'm hoping to learn how to do the following things to improve my website in the future:

1. Create a functional ToDoList tab 
2. Develop a "Trello" tab
3. Try out some cute CSS tricks
4. Link my next website! 


In the mean time, i'm going to enjoy a good night's rest! I'm so relieved that I was able to get past my hump and make so much more progress tonight! I don't know what functionally changed but I'm glad everything worked out in the end! Tomorrow i'm going to try to study my code again while making the ToDoList but who the heck cares now that it's working!
