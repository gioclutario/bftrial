## Intro Rant

For this blog post, I wanted to just quickly jot down some thoughts of how I want to motivate myself to build products and iterate on already established projects. Before I start my rant though, I want to at least congratulate myself once again on getting this Gatsby project up and running. I still want to update some aspects to this website and include things like my resume & also my portfolio but for the time being it is barebones that I can get these blog posts deployed! And now with our introduction complete, let us begin with today's rant on how I want to Start and maintain my habits.

## About Me and How I Find Motivation

For the longest time, my motivation for programming has always been based on curiosity and ease of introduction. By nature, I am an incredibly lazy person that would much rather provide guidance for others rather than following my own lessons and completing tasks on my own. This a major discredit to my own skill set but I want to be honest with myself first and layout all of my issues and grievances so that way I can address them now. By doing so, I can properly manage my vices to maintain my sense of motivation to do work. (To be continued? I could still additional lines on this paragraph?)

Speaking of work, in order to get anything done, work must be done. I may find myself daunted by the work in front of me but as of late, I realized that every task that requires moderate effort or thought will always look daunting. Nothing will change that fact. However, when I find myself constantly picking at pieces of projects here and just creating content without worrying about how much progress i've made or if what I made is even worth presenting, I am far more productive. How I like to think of it is like when I go hiking, I'm not necessarily worried about getting to the end of the trail as soon as possible. Instead, i'd much rather enjoy the journey and observe different parts of the hike such as the wind blowing or hearing the birds chirp. This crude model isn't exactly perfect but the idea is as follows: 

1. Picking a "trail",
2. Enjoy what is on the "trail", 
3. When you get to the end of the "trail", review what you've experienced and utilize that moment for future use.

## My Goal Moving Forward

> ### So with describing how I find motivation, what exactly is my goal moving forward?

Honestly, I currently can't say in detail what exactly I want but I do think that if I can discipline myself in writing everyday, whether it be writing code or writing blog posts,
