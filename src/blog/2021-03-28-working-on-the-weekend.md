So today has been a splendid day and I love everything about it /s.



Unfortunately, what was supposed to be just a quick in and out job today has become a major shit show. 

For starters, I basically woke up just as annoyed as I did last night. This lead to me waking up in a very neutral/peeved mood already. It was no suprise that we started fighting where I basically just ran out of the house cause I was sick and tired of the bs. It's not even like I didn't want food. I was, and am hungry. I would much rather just be left to my own devices than being literally spoon food when I am in a foul mood. He might call me an upgrateful spoiled brat but I will maintain my stance of apologizing for my actions today but I will not apologize for my DEMAND for some space. I have literally done what I can already within what little control I have of my of my own working space to create space to provide me with some sense of calmness and peace but the fact that the I still have to deal with him everyday pisses me off more and more. He thinks that making funny morbid joke makes me feel better but all I feel like is i'm replacing my emotional pain with a mask of laughter and stoned euphoria. I can keep laughing but after a certain point my laughter becomes emotionless and I'm just doing it for show rather than actual amusement. That's all I really feel nowadays, is my facade of annoyance just completely fading cause i don't care enough about these people to maintain an air of kindness & care. I just genuinely don't give a fuck about these people amymore.



I keep doubting my actions and thinking that Tyler is always right but the fact of the matter is that whether or not Tyler is right, I hate that he ALWAYS takes out my ability to choose success or failure. I'm tired of never being able to think of failing as an available option. It should be possible for all to fail but it seems like every day I learn that at the end of the day, it's a privilage to fail cause not everyone cause afford that moment of failure. Losing a job for one person can be completely different for another. And right now, I feel like i'm on track to fail getting a new job. I don't know how i'm going to be able to make as much money as I currently do. I don't know how i'm going to be able to afford saving up for a coding bootcamp if we're constantyl in the red. I don't know how to handle all of this shit without just removing Tyler's pressence completely and just solve both Financial & Work issues. If human emotions weren't such a fucking issue, we should have been debt free a year ago but that just isn't the case! 

All i can think of write now is angrily writing down my feelings but I don't think this is conductive at all! In order to acutally make use of these blog posts, I need to do an actual psychological evaluation of my works. I need to address
