This is crunch time. I'm possibly going to be unemployed by next month. 

I've been telling myself that I need to get a job asap possible but I'm currently feeling like I have no way to show employers why I am a fit candidate for their role and thus have been have half-heartedly applying to jobs and feeling like i've bene failing interviews. I've just been applying to jobs but not really created a proper portfolio to show employers what my true value is. I feel like I've just been undergoing interviews left and right trying to present myself as a competent employer trying to fit myself somewhere that can give my next paycheck but in all honesty I don't think I'm convincing anyone. It's really hard to show people my experience in a good light when I struggle to really find the words to articulate what my brain is processing. ~~I really just want to go back to counting and doing math instead of communicating!~~  

For now, I want to ignore everyone else and try to get some good studying out of the way. I know it's selfish but I feel that if I'm able to just shut out the world and silence all external noise, I can finally hone myself to create something worthwhile. I don't know what it is but I want to make something and that requires focus and perseverance. With this post comes a reality check and a status update. And in all honesty, a potential beginning to a good development habit. 

For starters, I need to actually accept that I have a credible background that's worth showing to employers. I don't know why I have this feeling of shame or possible imposter syndrome but I am a competent person. However, my competency can be easily questioned because of my lack there of retained knowledge from not being intellectually challenged in the past 3 years. There really is no way of going around it but my husband is right in that my current position has not challenged my educational background whatsoever. And as such, I have chosen to spend my 3 years wasting my knowledge away to enjoy spending time with my husband. I know I didn't waste my time but I know I can utilize it more efficiently to not only spend time with my family but also work on the things I want.  

One of my best profs was right in that it only takes 3 years of being out of school to waste all of my hard earned education. I'm sure a quick 2-3 months of hard earned studying could easily make me proficient with Chemistry again but it's going to be another uphill battle. One, I honestly am not opposed to. I really do love chemistry but I need to actually sit down and study it again. I can't spend my time gaming only but I can use it as a reward, if I can be disciplined. 
> As an aside, here is a cute little discovery I found from [this guide](markdownguide.org). Apparently, some Markdown processors have the ability to create "definition lists" which have the follow html: 
>```
>{
><dl>
> <dt> First Term </dt>
> <dd> This is the second term. </dd>
> <dt> Second Term </dt>
> <dd> This is one definition of the second term </dd>
> <dd> This is the other definition of the third term. </dd>
></dl>
>{
>```
> And when properly rendered it would look like the following but with a lot better formatting (see guide for actual example)
><dl>
> <dt> First Term </dt>
> <dd> This is the second term. </dd>
> <dt> Second Term </dt>
> <dd> This is one definition of the second term </dd>
> <dd> This is the other definition of the third term. </dd>
></dl>
> Back to normal reality check. 

So in order to better spend my time moving forward, I propose the following study pattern that can be applied at any period of time: 

- [ ] 25 minutes of studying
- [ ] 5 minute drink break 
- [ ] 10 minutes of reading 
- [ ] 15 minutes of exercises (or continued reading) 
- [ ] 5 minute roaming breaking 
- [ ] 30 minutes of studying 
  - If needed, consider the following instead for this depending on the subject at hand:
  - [ ] 15 minutes of creative thought
  - [ ] 15 minutes of practice exercises 
- [ ] Complete studying by enjoying the rest of your day 
- [ ] Repeat forever 

While this is listed as 90 minutes in duration, this schedule is very malleable in that you can reduce it down to 1 cycle. As most of you may know, this is exactly like the pomodoro techniques with the actual activities of my cycles filled in. I find that with brown noise combined with a pomdoro timer from [pomofocus.io](pomofocus.io), I am able to get into a zone of productivity. For the current time being I utilize this period of time to develop my website and my blog, I want to also utilize that time to study and potentially get ideas of what to develop for I am currently experiencing Tutorial hell in that I am constantly looking at what to do but not actually building any products. I am grateful that last year and this year has been very productive in my building capacity as I was able to deploy 2 websites, I still do not feel satisfied as I feel like my products are currently not up to par with what an actual product looks like. However, I feel that I should not take my achievements too lightly and accept that I have gotten further than others. I may just need to take that extra step further of putting in the work and understanding where my product needs to go. But in order to do so, I need to learn from others and see how my website can advance. 

With advancement in mind, I want to rewrite my list of previously proposed goals and actually set development deadlines so that I have something to work on and utilize my brain power towards while also exercising my knowledge of programming and web development. However, I also want to accept that this development of skills should be noted as something towards my true end goal of creating a truly open ended and automated safety platform. So i need to start honing my skills of 
 - Web Development
 - Software Development
 - Safety 
 - Chemistry 
 - Database Management 

to make the best product that I can. However, I need to also note that I cannot stop learning as while I may think I know somethings, the island of knowledge will be never ending and as such I should always see to find resources that can aggregate such information. Don't forget to rely on resources that C&EN, ACS, and other publications can provide as there is so much to learn. But also do note that I cannot forget what I have learned and must try to spend time recalling it or at least knowing where I can refer to that information. For now, I can utilize websites such as [Codecademy](codecademy.org) for programming practice and [Chem.libre](chem.libretexts.org) to start off but I also do need to start branching out. I need to actually start networking. 

Now for the actual list of revised goals: 

- [ ] Follow through with the following time management guidelines as stated above 
- [ ] Actually deploy Django website(?)/applications
- [ ] Improve my React/JS skills by going to react.org and actually following one of their build guides
- [ ] Review Molecular Dynamics practices and rewrite former project
- [ ] Complete Codecademy Data Science & Web Development paths

Now for the actual list of revised goals: 

- [ ] Follow through with the following time management guidelines as stated above 
  - Pomodoro technique is very useful but i need to **actually** sit down and do it
- [ ] Actually deploy Django website(?)/applications - `1 month`
  - I think i have a flask app right now so i need to deploy flask first then Django

- [ ] Improve my React/JS skills by going to react.org and actually following one of their build guides - `1 month` 
  - My react skills is okay. I can recognize things like JSX but i don't actually know how to build a website using that framework, nor do i really want to master it? 
- [ ] Review Molecular Dynamics practices and rewrite former project - `2 weeks`
  - Spend time on chemlibre and other MD websites to really develop this idea

- [ ] Complete Codecademy Data Science & Web Development paths - `2 weeks`
  - 2 pomodoro cycles per day to progress should be more than acceptable but I **need** to actually sit down and it! 
- [ ] Finish building out my portfolio website & including my actual resume. - `this weekend` 
  - The skeleton is good but ineed to put in the muscles and skin to make it an actual person.
