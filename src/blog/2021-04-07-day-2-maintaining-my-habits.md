### Intro Rant

Today has been a somewhat speedy day? I'm honestly not too sure how I want to describe today but it's been surprisingly fun! What i've mainly been doing instead of focusing on work is building a website from a quick and simple template. The overall look and feel of the website looks good.  

![Visual of the template of the website that I customized!](/img/screen-shot-2021-04-07-at-3.16.36-pm.png "Website First Look")

However, while I do like the feel of the website, I have gotten feedback from people at the clinic that the upfront design is a little overwhelming. I personally think it's such a super cool design but there doesn't seem to be any benefit of having it present other than flexing some JS/design skills.  I want to see if i can fix the content and just have it be dots cause it would be very fitting if that was the case!
