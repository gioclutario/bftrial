- Violations of expressiveness & natural assumptions being broken

- Y axis magnitude doesn't matter **but** left -> right convention cultural?

- Area misused?!?!?!?! WTF 

- Truncation? When does it matter? When is it a bad usage? 
  - Non 0 baseline !!!!!\

- Log scales? (This might actually matter for MD related information :( ) 
  - Good to show any exponential phenomena 


"Graphicacy" - Graphical literacy 
- HEY GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHERRRRRR WITH GRAPHS 
  - FUCK BANKS (REALLY MISLEADING GRAPHS) 

Dont shy away from things that people may question
