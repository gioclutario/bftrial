### Intro Rant

Today has been a somewhat speedy day? I'm honestly not too sure how I want to describe today but it's been surprisingly fun! What i've mainly been doing instead of focusing on work is building a website from a quick and simple template. The overall look and feel of the website looks good.  

![Visual of the template of the website that I customized!](/img/screen-shot-2021-04-07-at-3.16.36-pm.png "Website First Look")

However, while I do like the feel of the website, I have gotten feedback from people at the clinic that the upfront design is a little overwhelming. I personally think it's such a super cool design but there doesn't seem to be any benefit of having it present other than flexing some JS/design skills.  I want to see if i can fix the content and just have it be dots cause it would be very fitting if that was the case!

### Main Post

As far as maintaining habits go, I think of one of the most important aspects to consider is determining when are you the most productive. Lately, what i've found myself doing more is gathering my thoughts in the morning so I know what I am expected to do throughout the day or at the very least something to think about for the day. My little planner has been tremendous help with documenting said thoughts and ideas down for me to follow up on! However, now that i haven't used it for the past week, it's been really awkard not being able to look into my notebook to see what I told myself to follow up on! I think another feature of the planner that I like is that I have it formatted in a manner so that it's small chunks of my thoughts that allow me to resume the mindset I was in. I also, implemented a separate trick of using the phrase "Who(W) Will Do What By When(WWDWBW)? This allows me to hold myself accountable in terms of when I want the project done, by who, and a description of what the actual general task can be simplified to. All 3 of these techniques have allowed me to be able to go from work mode to developer mode back into work mode and also even into lazy mode without skipping a beat if I need to resume work after a hiatus.
