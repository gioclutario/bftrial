For this blog post, I wanted to just quickly jot down some thoughts of how I want to motivate myself to build products and iterate on already established projects. Before I start my rant though, I want to at least congratulate myself once again on getting this Gatsby project up and running. I still want to update some aspects to this website and include things like my resume & also my portfolio but for the time being it is barebones that I can get these blog posts deployed!
